# Wordle Hints  

This is a chrome extension that allows you to get hints when you're stuck for your next guess on [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).  

Simply install the extension from the chrome web store, and click the icon when playing the game. The extension will 
read the status of the board to see your previous guesses, and will make a suggestion for your next guess.  

It will also tell you how many possible answers are left*. If there are 10 or fewer suggestions left, it will list these
out for you.

*Note that since 11/2022, the New York Times curates the daily solution, so there is no master wordlist. It is possible 
that the possible solutions list is non-comprehensive.
